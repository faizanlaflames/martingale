# martingale
playing with the martingale strategy in python!

preface:
the martingale strategy is a betting system where a gambler doubles their bet after every loss, aiming to recover previous losses and make a profit equal to the initial stake. while it seems promising, the strategy is risky and often leads to financial ruin due to exponential bet increases.

run:
 $ python3 martingale.py and plots will be generated
